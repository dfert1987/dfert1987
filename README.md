###ðŸ‘‹ Hi my name is David Fertitta. I'm a versatile full stack web developer with a passion for developing applications that are as engaging and eye-catching as they are functional. I have ~1 year professional experience working as a frontend developer in an agile development team, building out a minimum viable product for an ERP software startup.

Prior to beginning my coding journey, I worked as a writer, graphic designer and marketer for fast-paced startups in Beijing, China. I've now returned to the US as a highly adaptable self-starter, with demonstrated success working both individually and as a team to drive quality results.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on finishing up my Portfolio site at the moment, but also my Wordpress style sports Blog, HOMER, which I'm building from the ground up with Rails and React.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Node and Vue.js
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with finding a job!
