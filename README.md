###👋 Hi my name is David Fertitta. I'm a versatile full stack web developer with a passion for developing applications that are as engaging and eye-catching as they are functional. I have roughly 2 years of professional experience working as a frontend developer on agile development teams, for both start ups and publicly traded companies.

Prior to beginning my coding journey, I worked as a writer, graphic designer and marketer for fast-paced startups in Beijing, China. I've now returned to the US as a highly adaptable self-starter, with demonstrated success working both individually and as a team to drive quality results.

- 🔭 At the momemnt I'm working on a Monopoly Game built entirely in React, and a turnbased Pokemon style RPG that I'm building with Vue.js.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Unity, and working as a software developer for Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.
